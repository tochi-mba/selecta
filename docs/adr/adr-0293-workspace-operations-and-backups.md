# ADR-293 - Workspace operations, storage, analysis and local backup layout

- **Decision:** Proposed (owner review pending).
- **Implementation:** 8/8 Not started; 0/8 In progress; 0/8 Implemented.
- **Independent verification:** 0/8 Verified.
- **Programme:** Selecta measured micro-polish (MP). **Priority:** P1. **Baseline:** `100df40463d05b3d6a4cba8f5d06cbe193a1b0c4`. **Owner:** Unassigned.
- **Existing ADR owners:** ADR-0230, ADR-0253, ADR-0263; old statuses unchanged.
- **Source touchpoints:** `web/src/views/Workshop.tsx`; `web/src/views/WorkshopPanels.tsx`; `web/src/views/LocalBackup.tsx`.

## Context and evidence boundary

Selecta already has extensive implemented UI, functional tests and earlier accepted design work. This ADR adds **measurable visual acceptance**, not a claim that these features are absent or defective. Existing source and historical criteria must be reconciled before implementation; a code observation alone is not proof of a visible usability problem.

## Proposed decision and alternatives

Audit the same route, state, theme, viewport, zoom and synthetic music data before and after any pixel-level change. Adopt the smallest change justified by measured layout and human review. Preserve existing design where it already passes and record specialist exceptions. Avoid unrelated feature additions or wholesale redesign.

## Implementation checklist - 0/8 Implemented; 0/8 independently Verified

1. **MP-0293-01 - Prioritise actionable issue.** **Acceptance:** Workspace Overview puts repair ahead of passive metrics. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.
2. **MP-0293-02 - Align workspace tabs.** **Acceptance:** Analysis, Sources, Storage, Learning and Diagnostics use common rhythm. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.
3. **MP-0293-03 - Handle long source paths.** **Acceptance:** Missing/relinked folder names remain readable with associated action. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.
4. **MP-0293-04 - Align storage budget.** **Acceptance:** GB amount, slider and warning share clear baseline. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.
5. **MP-0293-05 - Refine analysis status.** **Acceptance:** Queued, running, paused and failed jobs remain clearly differentiated. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.
6. **MP-0293-06 - Clarify backup restore.** **Acceptance:** Preview, consequence, restart and rollback actions are legible. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.
7. **MP-0293-07 - Quiet technical diagnostics.** **Acceptance:** Advanced data accessible without dominating ordinary support tasks. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.
8. **MP-0293-08 - Test independent repair.** **Acceptance:** User diagnoses and fixes top issue with no hidden controls. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** -; **Evidence/reviewer:** -.

## Negative tests and proof

**Common cases:** Light/Dark/System, forced colours, 320–3840px incl. short landscape, 200/400% zoom, keyboard/touch/NVDA, reduced motion, long/RTL/CJK/duplicate metadata, initial/loading/empty/partial/working/failed/offline/recovery and actual sound where relevant.

**Preservation:** Original local music unchanged; one player/audio-focus owner and deliberate Pause; real timing and song/seam occurrence; scoped current/draft revision and Undo; consented atomic request bridges; eight Studio lanes and 8–64 cells; canonical Library readiness and LRCLIB metadata disclosure; unbiased listening studies; frozen-revision decodable FLAC. Do not introduce a launcher, native folder picker, SaaS, accounts, telemetry or cloud audio.

**Proof:** An implementing PR/test SHA must be recorded for source status. A named independent reviewer, date, platform and concrete evidence are required to mark Verified. Synthetic or muted screenshots do not prove aesthetics or real audio. Docs-only work never advances implementation.

## Status governance

Decision Proposed → Accepted/Rejected/Superseded needs owner/date/rationale. Not started → In progress → Implemented needs an actual source/test PR and acceptance evidence. Independently Verified No → Yes needs separate required proof. Old programmes and task histories are untouched.
