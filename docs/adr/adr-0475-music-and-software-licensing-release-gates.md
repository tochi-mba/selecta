# ADR-0475 - Music and software licensing release gates

- **Decision:** Accepted by owner (2026-11-13); not implemented.
- **Implementation:** 0/4 Implemented; 4/4 Not started.
- **Independent verification:** 0/4 Verified.
- **Programme/date/baseline:** Local-first cloud refactor (LF); main `bfb2bd27938ac8b67e7d3e17125779cb092a8a3d`.
- **Earlier decisions:** ADR-0391 through ADR-0454 retain their historical statuses; ADR-0455 and this ADR supersede relevant hosted-user-audio assumptions only.
- **Programme:** [Roadmap](selecta-local-first-roadmap.md), [Implementation checklist](selecta-local-first-implementation-checklist.md), [Parity mapping](selecta-local-first-overlap-and-parity.md).

## Context

Public performance, copying, source rights, stems, export, installation and model distribution remain distinct legal questions even when audio stays local.

## Decision

1. UK music/IP counsel reviews the exact personal and venue flows, copying and public-performance rights, territory, and allowed sources before commercial rollout.
2. Review GPL distribution, Rubber Band/pedalboard, FFmpeg/codec dependencies, Demucs weights and S-KEY non-commercial limitations for packaged local engine.
3. Unapproved consumer-streaming downloads, DRM bypass, unlicensed P2P, server music streams and blanket attestation as a music licence are prohibited.
4. Record separate pilot and paid-launch approvals, risks and a rights-attestation version in the release gate.

## Edge cases and failure outcomes

Venue is licensed to play but not duplicate sources; model weights cannot be distributed commercially; exported mix is redistributed; different territory. Build tests must verify exact allowlist and written review.

Device-local audio truth and the existing user-facing creative capabilities must always be preserved. A cloud-accepted request or a saved recipe is not proof that a local player can execute it; missing, stale or forbidden media requires an explicit refusal or safe fallback.

## Compatibility and migration

Changes are staged with historical versions and source inventories; legacy hosted-media operations must not remain active as an accidental backdoor. Do not delete user recordings, edit historical acceptance evidence or mark incomplete code as implemented. Every affected UI state must explain the real execution location and available recovery.

## Required verification

Use synthetic media for automated tests, negative cloud-audio-egress assertions, appropriate role/tenant checks and both local and connected-mode parity. Record independent test evidence and a rollback decision before deleting an old contract.

## Rejected alternatives

- Keep the hosted media pipeline under renamed URLs or an undocumented transport.
- Silently lose a music/editor/venue capability to simplify implementation.
- Treat docs-only acceptance as source-code implementation.

## Implementation checklist - 0/4 Implemented; 0/4 independently Verified

1. **LF-0475-01 - Source and contract map.** **Acceptance:** map exact old/new schema, routes, UI ownership, capability parity and failure states. **Required verification:** independent source review. **Implementation:** Not started. **Independently Verified:** No.
2. **LF-0475-02 - Implementation.** **Acceptance:** implement all decisions while retaining existing local and connected user capabilities. **Required verification:** unit and integration suites. **Implementation:** Not started. **Independently Verified:** No.
3. **LF-0475-03 - Negative and edge coverage.** **Acceptance:** exercise every named failure and prohibit cloud transfer of audio. **Required verification:** security, E2E and fault tests. **Implementation:** Not started. **Independently Verified:** No.
4. **LF-0475-04 - Migration and release evidence.** **Acceptance:** demonstrate compatibility, rollback and independent operational/legal sign-off as applicable. **Required verification:** checked release ledger. **Implementation:** Not started. **Independently Verified:** No.

## Governance

Accepted design decision only. All LF implementation tasks are Not started.
