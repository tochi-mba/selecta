# ADR-290 — Requests drawer, pending status and bridge consent polish

- **Decision:** Proposed (owner review pending).
- **Implementation:** 8/8 Not started; 0/8 In progress; 0/8 Implemented.
- **Independent verification:** 0/8 Verified.
- **Programme:** Selecta measured micro-polish (MP). **Priority:** P1. **Baseline:** `100df40463d05b3d6a4cba8f5d06cbe193a1b0c4`. **Owner:** Unassigned.
- **Existing ADR owners:** ADR-0225, ADR-0262, ADR-0270; old statuses unchanged.
- **Source touchpoints:** `web/src/views/Requests.tsx`; `web/src/styles/operations.css`.

## Context and evidence boundary

Selecta already has extensive implemented UI, functional tests and earlier accepted design work. This ADR adds **measurable visual acceptance**, not a claim that these features are absent or defective. Existing source and historical criteria must be reconciled before implementation; a code observation alone is not proof of a visible usability problem.

## Proposed decision and alternatives

Audit the same route, state, theme, viewport, zoom and synthetic music data before and after any pixel-level change. Adopt the smallest change justified by measured layout and human review. Preserve existing design where it already passes and record specialist exceptions. Avoid unrelated feature additions or wholesale redesign.

## Implementation checklist — 0/8 Implemented; 0/8 independently Verified

1. **MP-0290-01 — Align drawer content.** **Acceptance:** Title, search, close and request list fit mobile and desktop widths. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
2. **MP-0290-02 — Refine result density.** **Acceptance:** Song, availability, reason and Ask remain readable with long titles. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
3. **MP-0290-03 — Group progress stages.** **Acceptance:** Searching, waiting, approval, preparing and ready remain distinguishable. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
4. **MP-0290-04 — Show bridge route clearly.** **Acceptance:** Additional tracks and transition ordering are explicit before consent. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
5. **MP-0290-05 — Tier consent actions.** **Acceptance:** Use this, Don't use a bridge and Play it anyway show their consequences. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
6. **MP-0290-06 — Protect async cancellation.** **Acceptance:** Late server results cannot reinsert a canceled request. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
7. **MP-0290-07 — Prevent overlay occlusion.** **Acceptance:** Virtual keyboard, toast and player never cover Submit/Cancel. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
8. **MP-0290-08 — Test requester comprehension.** **Acceptance:** Uncoached person understands uncertain outcomes and extra songs. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.

## Negative tests and proof

**Common cases:** Light/Dark/System, forced colours, 320–3840px incl. short landscape, 200/400% zoom, keyboard/touch/NVDA, reduced motion, long/RTL/CJK/duplicate metadata, initial/loading/empty/partial/working/failed/offline/recovery and actual sound where relevant.

**Preservation:** Original local music unchanged; one player/audio-focus owner and deliberate Pause; real timing and song/seam occurrence; scoped current/draft revision and Undo; consented atomic request bridges; eight Studio lanes and 8–64 cells; canonical Library readiness and LRCLIB metadata disclosure; unbiased listening studies; frozen-revision decodable FLAC. Do not introduce a launcher, native folder picker, SaaS, accounts, telemetry or cloud audio.

**Proof:** An implementing PR/test SHA must be recorded for source status. A named independent reviewer, date, platform and concrete evidence are required to mark Verified. Synthetic or muted screenshots do not prove aesthetics or real audio. Docs-only work never advances implementation.

## Status governance

Decision Proposed → Accepted/Rejected/Superseded needs owner/date/rationale. Not started → In progress → Implemented needs an actual source/test PR and acceptance evidence. Independently Verified No → Yes needs separate required proof. Old programmes and task histories are untouched.
