# ADR-287 — Editor timeline row grid, grips, seams and selection

- **Decision:** Proposed (owner review pending).
- **Implementation:** 8/8 Not started; 0/8 In progress; 0/8 Implemented.
- **Independent verification:** 0/8 Verified.
- **Programme:** Selecta measured micro-polish (MP). **Priority:** P0. **Baseline:** `100df40463d05b3d6a4cba8f5d06cbe193a1b0c4`. **Owner:** Unassigned.
- **Existing ADR owners:** ADR-0219, ADR-0220, ADR-0250; old statuses unchanged.
- **Source touchpoints:** `web/src/views/Mix.tsx`; `web/src/views/EditorRows.tsx`; `web/src/styles/creation.css`.

## Context and evidence boundary

Selecta already has extensive implemented UI, functional tests and earlier accepted design work. This ADR adds **measurable visual acceptance**, not a claim that these features are absent or defective. Existing source and historical criteria must be reconciled before implementation; a code observation alone is not proof of a visible usability problem.

## Proposed decision and alternatives

Audit the same route, state, theme, viewport, zoom and synthetic music data before and after any pixel-level change. Adopt the smallest change justified by measured layout and human review. Preserve existing design where it already passes and record specialist exceptions. Avoid unrelated feature additions or wholesale redesign.

## Implementation checklist — 0/8 Implemented; 0/8 independently Verified

1. **MP-0287-01 — Align song grid.** **Acceptance:** Grip, number, motif, title, facts and actions share stable columns. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
2. **MP-0287-02 — Attach seam visually.** **Acceptance:** Transition row clearly belongs between the corresponding song pair. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
3. **MP-0287-03 — Polish reorder targets.** **Acceptance:** Drag and keyboard movement affordances remain usable on narrow layouts. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
4. **MP-0287-04 — Differentiate object states.** **Acceptance:** Selected, focused, locked, playing and pending markers remain distinct. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
5. **MP-0287-05 — Preserve exact occurrence.** **Acceptance:** Reorder and duplicate tracks do not transfer selection incorrectly. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
6. **MP-0287-06 — Align add-gap controls.** **Acceptance:** Insert-between target visible without excessive visual noise. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
7. **MP-0287-07 — Refine editing scope bar.** **Acceptance:** Current/draft and Story/Arrange identity remains clear while scrolling. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.
8. **MP-0287-08 — Validate 100-song scenario.** **Acceptance:** Long arrangement stays fast, focused and audio-safe. **Required verification:** source-linked same-state geometry or screenshots, appropriate keyboard/functional regression and independent visual/AT/real-audio review where applicable. **Implementation:** Not started; **Independently Verified:** No; **Owner:** Unassigned; **Implementing PR/SHA:** —; **Evidence/reviewer:** —.

## Negative tests and proof

**Common cases:** Light/Dark/System, forced colours, 320–3840px incl. short landscape, 200/400% zoom, keyboard/touch/NVDA, reduced motion, long/RTL/CJK/duplicate metadata, initial/loading/empty/partial/working/failed/offline/recovery and actual sound where relevant.

**Preservation:** Original local music unchanged; one player/audio-focus owner and deliberate Pause; real timing and song/seam occurrence; scoped current/draft revision and Undo; consented atomic request bridges; eight Studio lanes and 8–64 cells; canonical Library readiness and LRCLIB metadata disclosure; unbiased listening studies; frozen-revision decodable FLAC. Do not introduce a launcher, native folder picker, SaaS, accounts, telemetry or cloud audio.

**Proof:** An implementing PR/test SHA must be recorded for source status. A named independent reviewer, date, platform and concrete evidence are required to mark Verified. Synthetic or muted screenshots do not prove aesthetics or real audio. Docs-only work never advances implementation.

## Status governance

Decision Proposed → Accepted/Rejected/Superseded needs owner/date/rationale. Not started → In progress → Implemented needs an actual source/test PR and acceptance evidence. Independently Verified No → Yes needs separate required proof. Old programmes and task histories are untouched.
